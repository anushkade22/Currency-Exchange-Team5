Exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency. A currency appreciates if it takes more of another currency to buy it and depreciates if it takes less of another currency to buy it.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create a dashboard which will allow users to analyze the exchange rates between two currencies over a period of time. Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format
Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc.

Introduction:
We have created a web application for finding the currency exchange rates according to the given problem statement.

Home Page:
We have three functionalities in the home page Home, Currency converter and View chart.
The Currency converter is used to give the USD, InR and other values of currency and converting one of them into another.
The View charts tab is implemented to showcase the graphs that are to be plotted when the user will select the required parameters.
